# squareball

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.rgm.io/buildStatus/icon?job=squareball-tests)](https://jenkins.rgm.io/job/squareball-tests/)

A general-purpose library for C99.


## About the library

This is `squareball`, a simple general-purpose library for C99. It is based on code extracted from [blogc](https://blogc.rgm.io/), that may be suitable for usage in other projects.

At this point, `squareball` just implements the stuff used by `blogc` itself, and may be quite incomplete for usage in other projects. Some implementations lack functions and basic stuff that may be required by other projects. We intend to improve the implementations as soon as possible.


## Copyright notice

`squareball` is based on code extracted from [blogc](https://github.com/blogc/blogc), to make it reusable by other applications. Its copyright is owned by the same owners of `blogc`'s copyright. See `LICENSE` file for details.


## Meaning of the library name

`squareball` library name is a tribute to [Quico](http://hero.wikia.com/wiki/Quico), that was Carlos Villagr√°n's character in the Mexican television sitcom *El Chavo del Ocho*. Unfortunately Quico never got his promised square ball. :-(
