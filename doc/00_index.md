# squareball Documentation

This is `squareball`, a simple general-purpose library for C99. It is based on code extracted from [blogc](https://blogc.rgm.io/), that may be suitable for usage in other projects.

At this point, `squareball` just implements the stuff used by `blogc` itself, and may be quite incomplete for usage in other projects. Some implementations lack functions and basic stuff that may be required by other projects. We intend to improve the implementations as soon as possible.
